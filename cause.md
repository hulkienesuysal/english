## Cause Essay

#### Introduction
What is stress and what causes it? When one person faces a threat or a demand, 
the body automatically releases some hormones that cause the person to feel stressed. 
This is a physical and psychological reaction of the body. 
Some people feel stressed when they are afraid of something and others feel stressed before a challenging situation such as an exam or a competition. 
`There are various causes of stress; however, the most important three causes are job pressure, money and relationships.`

#### Body 1 
`One of the causes of stress is job pressure.` Some jobs are demanding, and people need to work for long hours. 
For example, factory workers work under difficult conditions because they have to get the products ready on time. 
This causes them to feel stressed. On the other hand, CEOs of companies have very big responsibilities. 
They should not make any mistakes otherwise they may cause the business to fail. As a result, they feel stressed.

#### Body 2
`Another cause is money.` People who face money problems or are in debt may feel insufficient and worthless. 
Moreover, they may not earn their living and their quality of life gets worse. They start not eating properly and not following a healthy diet. 
Therefore, poor nutrition causes them to feel stressed because their bodies do not get enough minerals and vitamins. 
Moreover, as they constantly think of their money problems, they cannot sleep, and this causes them to feel stressed because they are mentally and physically tired.

#### Body 3
`Finally, relationships may cause stress.` Couples may have problems with their marriage life which may result in divorce. 
All this process affects peopleâ€™s body both mentally and physically leading to great amounts of stress. 
Furthermore, teenagers may feel stressed due to the problems they have in their relationships with their parents. 
When parents are too demanding or want their children to behave in the way they want them to behave, then teenagers feel stressed. 
The body starts to release stress hormones.

#### Conclusion
`In conclusion, stress has some important causes.` These can be physical or psychological. There is stress in every aspect of our lives. 
In my opinion, stress is not so bad as long as it does not affect your life negatively.
