#### Body 1
`The first type of education is online education.` Traditional education is when children attend classes to study. 
The main advantage is that children are around other children. Early socialization is so important in children’s development. 
Consequently, If children go to school, they can improve their communication and behavior skills. 
Moreover, children who go to school can learn how to cope early in life with pressure and trouble. 
Therefore, they can have self-confidence. `However,` the setup of each subject means learning is limited to a certain time frame.

For this reason, teacher cannot answer all the student’s questions.

In addition, students don’t have to attend specific course. `However,` online education can cause lack of motivation. 
Students cannot discus school’s materials with their friends because of distance. 
In addition, students who attend the online course be careful because they may mark absent because of connection and communication problems.

#### Body 3
`The final system of education is home-schooling.` Parents educate their children at the home. It has several advantages. 
Students can avoid many of the problems such as aggressive teacher. Moreover, parents can follow academic course and schedule, 
and they can teach their children more effectively. In addition, student can learn without fear. 
`However,` as well as some advantage, there are also some disadvantages. The main disadvantage is less socialized. 
Students cannot communicate their friends. For this reason, student’s behavior don’t improve. Moreover, many parent not qualified. 
Therefore, they don’t know everything.
