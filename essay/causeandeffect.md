## Cause & Effect Essay

#### Introduction
The Earthâ€™s climate has changed several times throughout history. According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), 
there have been seven cycles of warming and cooling in the last 650,000 years. These earlier cycles occurred naturally as a result of changes in the atmosphere. 
Almost all climate scientists agree that the climate is changing. `There are several causes and effects of climate change.`

#### Body 1 
`There are two main causes of global warming.` `One of them is burning fossil fuels and the other is deforestation.` `Firstly,` burning fossil fuels for energy leads to a rise in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, 
and results in higher temperatures. `Another cause of rising temperatures is deforestation.` Forests are cut down to provide agricultural land. 
Trees absorb carbon dioxide and breathe out oxygen. As a result, fewer trees leads to more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and consequently an impact on climate.

#### Body 2
`Two significant results of climate change are becoming apparent.` `The first effect is rising sea levels due to melting ice.` 
In the future, coastal areas could be flooded. In this case, people will lose their homes and there will be negative impacts on wildlife. 
`Another effect results from deforestation.` This causes loss of wildlife habitat. Animals, birds and plants lose their homes, and may become endangered or extinct. 
In addition, forests are important for our health as they help to supply us with oxygen.

#### Conclusion
`To conclude, human activity is clearly causing the climate to change and, as a result, the planet is experiencing a number of negative effects.` 
It is important that we reduce our negative impact on the planet as much as possible for example, 
by using renewable energy instead of fossil fuels- before it is too late.
